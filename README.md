Features
Dynamic Car Showcase: The portfolio features a dynamic car showcase where different car models are randomly displayed on each visit.

Interactive Environment: Users can toggle between a third-person and first-person view by pressing the 'k' key. The camera position changes accordingly, providing a different perspective of the 3D scene.

Interactive Triggers: Interactive triggers are implemented using the use-cannon library, allowing users to collide with specific elements in the scene. For example, colliding with certain elements opens external links, creating an interactive experience.

Video Texture: The portfolio incorporates video textures using Three.js, adding a unique touch to the text elements.

Post-processing Effects: Various post-processing effects such as bloom, chromatic aberration, and depth of field are applied, enhancing the visual aesthetics.
